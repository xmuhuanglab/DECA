Tips:
0. Before running this demo, please ensure that all dependent packages are installed.
0.1. Avoid altering the relative paths of files within the project while using this demo.
0.2. Run this demo in an environment with a GPU device for optimal performance.
0.3. Dividing the chromosome is optional; consider it for very robust devices or specialized projects with low-dimensional inputs.
0.4. If running the program for the first time, execute demo.ipynb before predict.ipynb to ensure all necessary files are complete.

Deformer is designed for training models and predicting cell type composition and chromatin accessibility from bulk ATAC datasets.
1.1. Deformer comprises two primary functional modules: training and prediction.
1.2. The training module is implemented in the demo.ipynb file, while the prediction module resides in predict.ipynb.

2. Pay close attention to the comments in the code to understand the significance of each variable.

3. The demo is derived from the GSM3034623 dataset, which includes four cell types, with 6895 peaks extracted during its creation.

If errors or unexpected situations occur, consider checking the following aspects:

4.1 Feature: The plot for the 'scale' is completely blank.
Issue: The peak count for a particular chromosome is less than 100 rows or not greater than 150 rows.
Solution: Skip this chromosome or increase the 'variance_threshold' parameter under the 'correct_patch()' function (up to a maximum of 1).

4.2 Feature: The values of the 'groundtruth' are different each time.
Issue: No seed is set.
Solution: Open the 'generate_pseudo_sample.py' file and check if 'random_state' has a default value. Alternatively, insert 'random_state= any natural number' between the 'Dominant' and 'sample_num' variables under the 'generate_pseudo_sample()' function to pass a value.

4.3 Feature: Incomplete execution, missing module error.
Issue: Module is missing.
Solution: Install the corresponding packages.

4.4 Feature: Incomplete execution, error stating "Found no NVIDIA driver on your system."
Issue: No GPU is available in the current environment.
Solution: Switch to an environment with a GPU.

4.5 Feature: Incomplete execution, error indicating missing files.
Issue: Incorrect or missing file naming.
Solution: Check if the modified filenames in the code are consistent and ensure the required source files are complete.

4.6 Feature: Incomplete execution, 'out of CUDA memory' error.
Issue: Insufficient GPU memory.
Solution: Reduce the 'batch_size' value or perform differential analysis on peaks to reduce their count. If possible, use a device with better performance.

4.7 Feature: Completion of execution, but unsatisfactory training results.
Issue: Complex problem.
Solution: Reduce the 'batch_size' value, adjust the 'epoch' value appropriately, increase the 'sample_num' value under the 'generate_pseudo_sample()' function, and clean the data to improve data quality.

4.8 Feature: Incomplete Execution, Error Message Indicates Inconsistency in Patch Numbers between Model and Bulk Data.
Issue: Discrepancy Arises Due to Various Reasons.
Solution: Re-call Peaks in Bulk Data to Align with Single-Cell Reference Data or Perform Intersect Alignment of Peaks.
